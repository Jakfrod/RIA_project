# University of Applied Science's Rich Internet Application Branch Project : Deepest Dungeon

## Abstract

This project was made in a school setting for the module "624-2 GÃ©nie Logiciel". Its main purpose was to autonomously get a better understanding on how HTML, CSS and Javascript work.

The finished product and the content used to produce it was limited by our own personal knowledge and the help of our own research. With this, we do not intend to plagiarize or rip off any already existing game, that may ressemble ours in any way shape or form.

## Introduction

### Game's objective

The player embodies a character who must pass several levels while fighting a monster. The goal is very simple, not to die. Thus, the player who passes the most levels without dying will have the highest score. 

### Characters

The player can choose between two characters, the first is a fearsome monster hunter in the Deepest Dungeon universe, the second is the son of the King of Deepest Dungeon, who has decided to save the world from evil and malicious creatures.

### Rules

The rules are simple, you must survive each "room" generated. When the player kills the monster in the room, a new one is generated until the player dies. Every two rooms, the life of the monster increase. The goal is to survive as long as possible, in as many rooms as possible. 

## Conclusion

This was a good experience overall for all the members of our group. We were able to learn new things by ourselves, and managed to learn how to communicate and work better as a team. However, with all the work outside of this class that we had to do, as well as all the research, it was a bumpy road all throughout the duration of the project.

Sadly, the current pandemic greatly diminished our ability to work as a team, as it did not allow us to see each other. We do feel that face-to-face contact is easier than virtual contact.

Furthermore, the things we had learned during class, although already knowledgeable, still stayed general for what we wanted and had to do. To persevere, we had to do some serious research and learn by ourselves what we had not yet seen, which was not an easy task.

All in all, we are happy with the outcome of the project, and think that it was a good working experience, and we may even encounter a similar situation in the future.

Now that we are done talking, you can thoroughly enjoy our project !

Good luck !
